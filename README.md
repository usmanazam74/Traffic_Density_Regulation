# Traffic_Density_Regulation
Nowadays, controlling the traffic has become a major concern because of the rapid increase in automobiles and also because of large time delays between traffic lights. 
So, in order to rectify this problem, we built a density-based traffic signal regulation project. We used the Texas Instrumentsâ€™ ARM-based Tiva-C series microcontroller
TM4C123GH6PM Launchpad that served as the heart and soul of this project.
